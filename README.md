# Custom Minecraft Launcher
This is a custom Minecraft launcher written on ElectronJS that I made for my server. It allows the user to login with a Mojang account and select a few different presets. Since my server has a vanilla world and a modded world, the default presets are those, but it can be edited to change them.

## Requirements
- Electron Packager (npm install electron-packager -g)

## How to Compile
Simply compile as you would with any other ElectronJS application, nothing special.
